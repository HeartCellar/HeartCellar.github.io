                When I was fifteen years old Black Panther had just exploded at the box-office, and my
                family was taking a trip down to Atlanta to see my mom’s best friend from elementary school
                and her partner; a queer couple each involved with abolishing the South’s brutal prison-industrial
                network. I always loved visiting Xochi and Kung Li

                , experiencing the Latin-Asian fusion of
                their small house, and the ever-changing area outside their front porch. I didn’t then understand
                why the neighborhood would change so drastically between my family’s sporadic visits, but I
                knew that I loved the city even as it warped. In Williamstown, where me and my brother grew
                up, Blackness was an indoor activity; getting ready for a trip beyond our doors was handled
                delicately. I can remember the look on my dad’s face when outfits or behaviors did not fit the
                description of his idea of an acceptable Black-man; the look I knew he’d echo when the white
                people in town began their bullshit around us; because of us. Atlanta was never like that. It was
                big and loud and free. We’d take walks and my brother and I would marvel at all the Black kids,
                and their parents, expressing themselves however they wanted wherever they went. We awed at
                the colors and the clothing, even laughing when we saw an older Black man in a Canadian
                Tuxedo adorned with a confederate flag belt-buckle. “Atlanta’s crazy,” we’d think, before
                heading to the mall to shop for sneakers, and stopping by the movie theater most nights to see
                our new anthem with an audience it was made for.

                My mom was adamant that we spend some time outside of the places where kids wanted
                to go. When I was ten and my brother seven we’d seen the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.’s
                house, and visited the remembrance center built in his name where marble statues marched, and
                the eternal flame where equality’s representation never faltered in its fiery fight against the
                hegemony. This time, we were older. This time, we were ready to move beyond the slide-show
                fourth-grade Scholastic version of our own history, and understand what really went down. I
                remember the shape of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights disturbing me as we
                approached it. I didn’t then understand why. Now, as I look back on photos of it to jog my
                incomplete memory, I realize the sleek and curved bronze metal and the new-age and advanced
                modern architecture looks bafflingly like the hull of a ship. The bottom half, of course, where
                cargo is held and where water’s pressure pounds, not the top half where wind fills romantically
                luffing sails and merry seamen sing shanty songs of the freedom of the open seas. Perhaps this
                was the center’s architect’s design
                <div class="tooltip">2
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        As far as I can tell, this was not the purpose of the design. Architect Magazine, Perkins &
                        Will, and ArchDaily all describe the
                        curvature of the walls as “powerful,” and “a space for action.” Which is wonderfully
                        contradictory and hilariously ironic.

                . In the third chapter of her book, In the Wake: On Blackness
                and Being, Christina Sharpe cites the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of the term
                hold—“a large space in the lower part of a ship or aircraft in which cargo is stowed. (of a ship or
                an aircraft); continue to follow (a particular course); keep or detain (someone); a fortress”
                (Sharpe 68) I can’t help but hear each definition as I recall what followed. The countertop.

                Perhaps fittingly, my family was mostly alone. Xochi was there as our ATL tour guide,
                but we’d gotten to the Center fairly early in the day and so it was me, fifteen, my brother, twelve,
                and my white-half-Jewish mother walking the halls unsupervised. I can’t recall the order in
                which we saw the exhibits or really much of what followed or predated my sitting at the counter.
                But I can remember that sit-in in excruciating detail. Knowing what befell us in that room, and
                after Xochi consulted with my mom and the white-worker at the doorway, it was decided George
                was probably too young to try the sit-in simulator. I was not. As if, in America, something innate
                happens between the ages of twelve and fifteen that turns a Black-boy into a Black-man; the kind
                whose understanding of the ongoing fight might just be what keeps him and his little brother
                alive down the road

                        I can’t help but think of Sharpe’s later words here: “another indication that the meaning of
                        ‘child,’ as it abuts Blackness falls… apart” (Sharpe
                        80).

                . So I sat. With my white-mom beside me, I laid my hands on the counter,
                and put on the headphones and closed my eyes.

                I’ve always had a vivid imagination. My brain runs itself down tangents wherever it goes.
                I’ve always had a near-perfect memory; if I’m told something or I write it down, I hold it forever.
                I was told, that day on that tour, a lot of things that have been wiped away by this experience. I
                had been told, before that day on that tour, that sometimes the white patrons at the white-only
                restaurants where sit-ins would take place would crack glass-ketchup bottles over the heads of
                the silent and peaceful Black protestors. When my eyes were closed and the southern-shouts in
                my simulated nightmare grew louder and more focused, as I heard glass shatter and that
                wonderful n word and boy and mutt and all those things I’d always imagined the white-world
                around me wanted to say—I imagined ketchup trickling through my afro and running down my
                face like blood. I don’t know how long I did this. I’d always done well in the dark. In the Black
                darkness of the hold your imagination is all there is. So I kept imagining that I couldn’t feel
                something hot and angry in my chest and stomach, I imagined that one day I’d get revenge on all
                the fake bigots hired by a voice-acting company to assail me at my own leisure, I imagined that
                the world would still look the same when I opened my eyes. It didn’t.

                Sharpe writes later on in her third chapter “The Hold” of the Jewish slaughtered after
                one-way train rides to death-camps in the Second World War: “those arrivants… from all over
                Europe, who will never depart and do not know the language of the guards, must learn a new
                language through kicks, punches, rifle butts, and shots. A mother slaps a child; the guards yell,
                hit, and pull; language falls apart” (Sharpe, 69). I think of this now, as I retrace the course I’ve
                held since my mother slapped her hand onto my wrist on the counter-top, and shocked my eyes
                open. Her headphones were off already and her eyes were full of tears; that look of regret you
                hate seeing in the face of your parent. Oh, I might’ve thought then, she knows she just fucked me
                up forever.

                But she might not have known. I did not know. In the hold, language falls apart. That hot
                thing in my stomach; I swallowed a few times and it hid itself once more. That disturbed thing in
                me; we left the museum and I remembered my father’s lessons, and tried not to make a scene. In
                the hold, where language melts and there is only shadowy marginless feeling, we Black people
                often do not know what to say to make those around us believe we are not okay in a way we
                need help handling. In my experience, we often do not know what to think to make our own
                Black bodies feel that we are not imagining things. Our trauma and our suffering is assumed and
                ignored, even by ourselves.

                are you remembering? If the rememberee6 happens to be a slave owner or a problematic
                American patriot, a proud statue of marble or a tarnishable one of bronze is always fitting. If the
