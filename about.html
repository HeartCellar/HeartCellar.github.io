                The continued disenfranchisement of people of color from cultural, artistic, and political discourse perpetuates malicious anti-historical narratives and supports the active white-washing of racial identities.<br><br>

<em>Heart Cellar</em> is an online publication built to champion the voices of people of color in an era of systemic silencing of oppressed racial communities. 

By curating works from writers of color, Heart Cellar serves an engaged community of readers seeking thought-provoking essays from the intellectual, artistic, and cultural perspectives of people of color.
